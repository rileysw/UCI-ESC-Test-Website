This escan is an updated version for E-Week 2018 based on Sean Burke's original project. 
All respective credit goes to the original creator and the succeeding webmasters.
His original project is found under /OLD_SITE/escan. 

The new version of escan has been updated to include 3 giveaway checkboxes instead of just one. 
Data for student grade level is no longer collected due to the omission by the UCI public directory.
The escan files only needed for the E-week check in has been ported to the new 2017-18 website.
